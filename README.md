# ITSMAP-01
This is some of the android apps made in the course ITSMAP-01. 
Some of them are made in IntelliJ IDEA and others in android studio
Disclaimer: These were hacks made for / during the lesson and are not gold standard / best practise, nicely documented or in any way production ready code to be used for anything else but learning in this course :) 
Not updated for Material Design / newest compatibility

It should say "Hello World". If you have an Android device at hand, try to run it on the device as well. 1b) Add a Button with the label "Hello" to your GUI - when the user presses this button the TextView should change from "Hello World" to "Hello Android!" 1c) Try to experiment a bit with layout parameters, text properties etc. switching between the design and text/XML mode1d) Add a new Button labelled "Exit" - when the user presses this button the app should exit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Done                      |
| 2: Click counter                                                                               | 2a) Create a new project using the "blank activity" template - this should give you a nice material design based UI with a round FAB button 2b) We want to keep track of how many times the button is pressed and display it to the user in a TextView - add this behavior to the activity. Add a variable in the Activity that keeps count and update the text on the screen every time the button is pressed. 2c) What happens when you rotate the device? Why? Can we fix this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Done                      |

Overwrte ALL the main life-cycle events of your main Activity and add a Log entry that matches the event, e.g.: Log.d("LifeCycle", "onStop() called");, 3. Use LogCat, the integrated logging system, to monitor the life-cycle events of your app as you rotate your device/emulator - what is the sequence of calls? 4.Try using the debugger as well                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Done                      |

ViewActivity should have an "edit" Button that starts the EditActivity 3. EditActivity should have an EditText input field where the user can type some text and a button called "OK", which then sends this data back to the first Activity 4. ViewActivity should have a TextView that is initially empty - after having edited something the latest data entry from the EditActivity should be in this TextField 5. EditActivity should also have a "Cancel" button that takes the user back but does not update the TextView in ViewActivity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Done                      |

Also the text edit fields in A2 should be pre-populated with the current values from A1. The user should be able to choose "ok" or "cancel" to the edits made in A2 and then return to A1 Furthermore the user must be able to take a picture/selfie and add it to the profile as a thumbnail (D). This should be done using any Camera app installed on the device already. To take the picture, the user must click the image in the interface (when no picture is added, just show a placeholder)You must use resource externalization throughout the app. You app should support at least two languages for all labels, buttons, etc. English must be one of them. You will need to handle both portrait and landscape modes and optimize the layout of information in accordance with the sketch below. You need to handle orientation changes so the user does not loose any data. You should re-style the app with your own Material Design colors You app must have a custom icon        | Done                      |

Create a third button that calls the service directly (if bound) and retrieves the state; then prints it out                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Done                      |

Add a new IntentService using Android Studio and add the default example methods for Foo and Baz 2. Create two buttons in your activity that sends new Foo and Baz requests to your IntentService 3.
