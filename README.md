| 1: Hello Android              | 1a) Create a new project using the "empty activity" template - build the app and run it in the emulator. It should say "Hello World". If you have an Android device at hand, try to run it on the device as well. 1b) Add a Button with the label "Hello" to your GUI - when the user presses this button the TextView should change from "Hello World" to "Hello Android!" 1c) Try to experiment a bit with layout parameters, text properties etc. switching between the design and text/XML mode1d) Add a new Button labelled "Exit" - when the user presses this button the app should exit                                    | Done   |
| 2: Click counter              | 2a) Create a new project using the "blank activity" template - this should give you a nice material design based UI with a round FAB button 2b) We want to keep track of how many times the button is pressed and display it to the user in a TextView - add this behavior to the activity. Add a variable in the Activity that keeps count and update the text on the screen every time the button is pressed. 2c) What happens when you rotate the device? Why? Can we fix this?                                                                                                                                                 | Done   |
| 3: Welcome to Hollywood       | 1.Create a new blank application with one MainActivity 2. Overwrte ALL the main life-cycle events of your main Activity and add a Log entry that matches the event, e.g.: Log.d("LifeCycle", "onStop() called");, 3. Use LogCat, the integrated logging system, to monitor the life-cycle events of your app as you rotate your device/emulator - what is the sequence of calls? 4.Try using the debugger as well                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Done   |
| 4: Selifie Swap Arnie Edition | 1. Create a new application 2. Build a basic user interface with two ImageViews and a button called "swap". 3. Add some pictures of Arnie (or some other iconic images),in the ImageViews 4. Now make the pictures switch every time you press the button 5. Make sure the app remembers the order of pictures,when you rotate the device                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Done   |
| 5: There and back Again       | 1. Create a new application with two activities: MainActivity and SecondActivity 2. Create a Button in you MainActivity user interface that takes the user to SecondActivity. 3. SecondActivity must have a Button where the user returns to the MainActivity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Done   |
| 6. Post-It                    | 1. Create a new application with two Activities: ViewActivity and EditActivity 2. ViewActivity should have an "edit" Button that starts the EditActivity 3. EditActivity should have an EditText input field where the user can type some text and a button called "OK", which then sends this data back to the first Activity 4. ViewActivity should have a TextView that is initially empty - after having edited something the latest data entry from the EditActivity should be in this TextField 5. EditActivity should also have a "Cancel" button that takes the user back but does not update the TextView in ViewActivity | Done   |
| 7. Good Intentions            | 1. Create a new application with just one Activity 2. Continue to add new buttons to the interface that invokes various actions on the Android interface (note: someof these might behave different whether you have a physical device or using emulator).For instance:Take a picture with the cameraRecord a VideoSend an emailSend an SMSStart a phone callSet an Alarm                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Done   |
